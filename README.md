# Abstract
*"Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose. To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society."* - Laurence D. Fink, CEO BlackRock (largest asset manager in the world)

Asset managers are increasingly challenged by their investors to manage their portfolios for social impact. However, it is non-trivial for investors and investment managers to maintain regular oversight over the social impact composition of their portfolios. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) EDGAR maintains a digital record of the portfolio filings of publicly traded asset managers. All the News is a Kaggle dataset of news articles primarily from 2016 to 2017. 

Furthermore, it could be interesting to correlate the greater public's interest into social good projects expressed on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, or news platforms, with the actual investments that are done. 

# Research questions
- How to map news article sentiments to specific investments held by companies?
- What are the most popular “ethical” or “unethical” investments held by asset managers?
- What asset managers have the portfolios with the greatest/least social impact?
- What is the great public's opinion regarding the companies that held many investments in social good versus those who do not invest in social good? 
  - How to make a ranking of “public opinion” regarding a company?
- Was there a transition toward investing more into social good then into other projects? If yes, when did it happen?
- Can we extend the project to other countries in other to build a global social good investment chart? 

# Dataset
List the datasets containing the information needed to answer the above-mentioned questions: 

- [The news](https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news/home)

- [SEC asset manager portfolios](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=&CIK=&type=13F&owner=include&count=40&action=getcurrent)
- Twitter : 1% of the tweets of 2017 - On the ADA Cluster

Once the project topic was chosen, the group spent a considerable amount of time to look at the quality of the data. For the members, it was important to make sure that the time allocated to the project will be spent on data science and information extraction and not data cleaning.

Our group found some libraries to generate a .csv-like file listing, by company and date, the URLs in the SEC's archives where the [investment portfolio filings](https://github.com/edouardswiac/python-edgar) are stored as consistently structured text and HTML table data. We will be able to programmatically extract the type and scope of different types of asset manager investment holdings (what companies they invested in, the size and value of each investment). This data can be enriched by processing additional news and social data related to portfolio companies into signals of their social impact and mapping these social impact signals to investment portfolios. Based on this data from investment portfolio filings, we hope to be able to identify and analyze investments made in companies that pursue goals related to *social good* from all different kinds of industries. 

Regarding the dataset on Kaggle, we took a closer look to the comments made about the data and we found no issues. Moreover, the download of the 3 .csv files was done. The structure is well defined with several columns (title, publication, author, data, year, month, URL, content). The size of the dataset is small. 

The Twitter data is a dataset provided by the course so we are confident that there should not be too many insolvable issues and the data does not look *too bad*. The documentation of Twitter API was analyzed to understand how to use this database. First, determination of a dictionary of keywords linked to our subject will be done (and possibly Machine Learning algorithms will be used to broaden it throughout work process). Finally, the tweets will be filtered thanks to the buolt dictionary in order to construct the dataset of interest.

### Milestone 3 Objectives (MS3) - Final Milestone
- Feedback from MS2: Due to the large number of projects that the group is accumulating through the different classes that each group member is taking, we decided to adopt a very structured approach for this project. We took advantage of GitHub's possibility to define issues, to assign them and to label them. Therefore at each meeting tried to summarize in a few issues the task to do until the next meeting. The tickets can be seen [here](https://github.com/dcleres/investing_for_social_good/projects/1). This second milestone was marked by the fact that we also had Homework 4 to handle in parallel. However, we succesfully managed to work on both tasks. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the working hours put into the project were restrained. From the objectives set in MS1, the one labelled with the check are the objectives what we managed to finish at 100%. The ones wihtout check are either in progress or had to be delayed to the 3rd milestone since they came too early in the pipeline. The work that was performed in MS1 is contained in [this notebook](https://github.com/dcleres/investing_for_social_good/blob/master/milestone_2_notebook.ipynb). 
- From the knowledge acquired in MS1, we were able to define the following goals for the next milestone: 
  - Task Group 1 - Tasks left from MS1 
    - [x] Determine a dictionary of keywords linked to emotion and opinion identifiers regarding companies
    - [X] Decide which visualizations formats serve the best our purpose when the data will be shown on the online platform of choice
      - See on D3.JS --> [D3 Force-Directed Graph](https://beta.observablehq.com/@mbostock/d3-force-directed-graph). Make one plot for the investors and in which domain they do invest. 
      - Just for fun : https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3231298
      - Interesting idea : https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/feb/12/state-of-the-union-reading-level

  - Task Group 3 - Sentiment Analysis - *This task was started in MS2. However, we need to be careful about the implementation since being mentionned positively on Twitter or in the News does not necessarily mean that the company is investing in social good. Therefore, to have a proper scoring we need more then the 2 weeks (and homework 4) that we had until now.*

#### Questions for TA's

- What technologies do professional data blogs like FiveThirtyEight use for visualization?\
    **ANSWER** : *For fancy visualisation, you can use D3.js, for simple one you can use some wrappers of D3.js (C3.js)* 
- Is the content we have enough to make a project?\
    **ANSWER** :  *You seem to have enough content for now. Once you start exploring the dataset you can reiterate on your research questions and refine them if needed.*
