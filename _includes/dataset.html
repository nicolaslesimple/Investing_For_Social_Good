                    The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dataset

                            For this project, two datatsets were used. The first dataset consisted of the
                            <a href="https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=&CIK=&type=13F&owner=include&count=40&action=getcurrent">U.S. Securities
                                and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> archives. It was possible generate a
                            .csv-like file listing, by company and date since the URLs in the SEC's archives, where the
                            investment portfolio filings are stored, has consistently structured text and HTML table data.
                            We were able to automate the extraction and so to get the type and scope of different types of asset
                            manager investment holdings (what companies they invested in, the size and value of each investment).
                            This data can be enriched by processing additional social data from twitter related to portfolio companies
                            into signals of their social impact and mapping these social impact signals to investment portfolios.
                            <br>
                            Based on this data from investment portfolio filings, we could identify and analyze investments
                            made in companies that pursue goals related to social good from all different kinds of industries.
                            <br>
                            Nevertheless, one need to be careful with the interpretation of the data. This data set contained
                            biases that one need to be aware of before drawing general conclusions from the data.
                            First, the data is collected quarterly and contains information about all the major players
                            of the US stock market. It would have been interesting to have the same kind of information
                            about Switzerland and the rest of the world also. However, the SEC dataset was the most
                            complete and consistent information we were able to find. Therefore, any conclusion that we could
                            make is likely to be true from the USA but not necessarily for the rest of the world. <br>

                            Secondly, the dataset contains only the institutional investment managers with holdings over 100M <br>

                            Furthermore, the <i>13F form</i> is required to be filed within 45 days of the end of a calendar quarter
                            (which should be considered as significant information latency) only reports long positions
                            (not short) different investment managers pursue different strategies with may bias results.
                            However, the vast majority of investment managers rely significantly on long positions for significant
                            portion of fund performance. <br>

                            Another drawback is that the 13F form does not reveal international holdings (except for
                            American depositary receipts) and excludes total portfolio value and percentage allocation of
                            each stock listed <br>

                            The Section 13(f) securities generally include equity securities that trade on an exchange (including Nasdaq),
                            certain equity options and warrants, shares of closed-end investment companies, and certain convertible debt securities.
                            Shares of open-end investment companies (i.e. mutual funds) are not Section 13(f) securities
                            <a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13flists.htm">The official list of qualifying securities</a>
                            <br>

                            Finally, it is necessery to point out at 13F does not represent the whole portfolio of the investos - it's a past snapshot.

                            The twitter dataset consisted of the tweet from 2017. The research question that needed enrichment
                            with social media data were all focused on the evolution throughout time of the opinion regarding
                            selected companies. Therefore, we did not need to take the data from everyday. It was decided
                            that it would be wiser and sufficient to take 10-days samples through the year 2017. This made
                            the calculation feasible in Pandas.
                            Since we were looking for information about investors and companies in the USA, we decided to
                            only look at the tweet in English. This reduces the number of tweet per day by roughly 70% the majority
                            of the Tweet are written in the mother tongue of the user (Chinese, Japanese, German, ...)
